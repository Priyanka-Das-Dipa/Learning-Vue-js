# Reaction Timer App

### A simple and fun web app built with Vue.js to test your reaction speed. Click as fast as you can when the box appears — your reaction time will be measured in milliseconds, and you’ll get a rank based on your performance (Pro, Average, or Beginner).

### How It Works

## Click Play to start the game ->

- Wait until the purple box appears — don’t click early!

- As soon as it appears, click the box as fast as you can.

- Your reaction time (in milliseconds) will be displayed with a rank:

* 🥇 Pro → under 250ms

* 🥈 Average → 250–399ms

* 🥉 Beginner → 400ms or more
